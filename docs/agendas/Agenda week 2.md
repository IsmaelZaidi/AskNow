In italics you will find some additional explanations of the agenda points. You will find mostly the same points in the next agendas.

# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

- No agenda for this week yet


# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*

- Creating boards on GitLab for the issues
- Creating code of conduct

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

- Create draft backlog & prototype design
- Retrospective for this week's meeting

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*



# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
