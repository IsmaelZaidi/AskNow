- Must haves - delete (creating request updating) / upvote (creating request + updating) / marking (as answered) 
- Go over everyone tasks for the week
- Show what we have until now


# Points of action
*The items below are things you should look into after the first meeting. During the meeting you can divide (some of) the work between the team members, so that everybody has something to do afterwards.*


# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

- Finish all the must haves
- Create prototype + questionaire for the heuristics evaluation
- Finish all the functionality on the current views
- start on finishing the should haves 

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

- Question about the presentation

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
