    person
7. find original features to distinguish our project from others
8. if encountering problems with adding a feature and another colleagues know how to do it, they
    should work as a team, so that both parties get experience
9. have a plan when staring adding a feature, fist have a layout on paper or any other means of
    visualizing

    week

# Naming conventions:

2. name your commit, added feature, bugfixes
3. a main development branch, when the devbrach is bug free and works correctly, vote on
    committing to master, master should always be working
4. branch naming, first the type of commit dash then camel casing (ex. bugfix-chatboxNullPoint )
