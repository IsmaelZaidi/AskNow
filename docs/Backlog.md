## Alt-Backlog

**For the backlog we use prioritized user stories in the following the Moscow categories:**
 
  | **Moscow**  |
  |-----------|
  | Must have   | 
  | Should have | 
  | Could have  |
  | Won't have  |

Here we will define the prioritized user stories in the following format (as a **(role)**, I want **(desired outcome)** so that **(reason)**)

**Must have:**
*	As a student I want to create questions so that the question flow during the lecture will be optimal
*	As a teacher I want to have the option to only see the most popular / relevant questions so that I don’t get spammed
*	As a student I want to be able to upvote questions to show that I also have that question or would like it answered
*	As a student I want to be able to indicate if the lecture goes to slow or to fast so that the teacher can adjust his pace
*	As a student I don’t want an authentication to log in so that it is easier to join sessions
*	As a teacher I don’t want students replying to each other so that the chat doesn’t become to cluttered
*   As a teacher / moderator I want users to fill in a username so that I can distinguish between them
*   As a moderator I want to be able to reply to questions so that questions don’t always have to be answered verbally
*   As a teacher / moderator I want to mark questions as answered so that students know it's already been discussed
*   As a student I want to be able to see which questions are marked as answered so that I don't ask it again
*   As a teacher / moderator I want to be able to see which questions are marked as answered so that I don't answer it again

**Should have:**
*   As a teacher / moderator I want answered questions to have a timestamp so that I have a way of review the lecture
*   As a TA I want to have a readme file so that I can run and verify the system easily
*	As a moderator I want to hide / delete / rephrase questions so that the question flow is optimal and there are no duplicate questions .
*	As a moderator I want the possibility to ban an IP temporarily so that the chat environment stays friendly 
*	As a student I want the possibility to report a question so that I can help the moderator in seeing inappropriate messages
*	As a university I want the possibility to have multiple rooms at the same time so that more lecturers can make use of the application 
*	As a teacher I want scoring system that takes popularity / age in account so that I only see the most relevant questions 
*	As a teacher I want the ability to schedule rooms so that I can plan beforehand 
*	As a teacher I want different joining codes for students and moderators so that I can delegate who the moderator will be 
*   As a teacher I want the data to be saved after the sessions so I can see and answer questions later
*   As a user I want the system to be able to restart and recover from crashes without problems so that I don't lose data
*   As a teacher / moderator I want to be able to close a lecture so that questions can't asked anymore
*   As a teacher / moderator I want to enter a closed lecture so that I can export the questions into a file
*   As a teacher / moderator I want to enter a closed lecture so that I can answer remaining questions

**Could have:**
*	As a teacher / moderator I want that students can only ask a certain amount of questions per time frame so that the teacher doesn’t get spammed.
*	As a teacher I want the questions to be real time (push pull system) so that the questions are relevant
*	As a teacher I want the ability to have polls that I can also reopen so that I can gather information about the students' understanding of the lecture.
* As a teacher I want the ability to have quizzes with a correct answer so that I know whether the students understood a notion.
