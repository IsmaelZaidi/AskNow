## Alt-Backlog

**For the backlog we use prioritized user stories in the following the Moscow categories:**
 
  | **Moscow**  |
  |-----------|
  | Must have   | 
  | Should have | 
  | Could have  |
  | Won't have  |

Here we will define the prioritized user stories in the following format (as a **(role)**, I want **(desired outcome)** so that **(reason)**)

**Must have:**
*	As a student I want to create / delete / edit questions so that the question flow during the lecture will be optimal
*	As a teacher I want to only see the most popular / relevant questions so that I don’t get spammed
*	As a student I want to be able to upvote questions to show that I also have that question or would like it answered
*	As a student I want to be able to indicate if the lecture goes to slow or to fast so that the teacher can adjust his pace
*	As a student I don’t want an authentication to log in so that it is easier to join sessions
*	As a teacher I don’t want students replying to each other so that the chat doesn’t become to cluttered

**Should have:**
*	As a moderator I want to hide / delete / rephrase questions so that the question flow is optimal 
*	As a moderator I want the possibility to ban an IP so that the chat environment stays friendly / unspammed 
*	As a student I want the possibility to report a question so that I can help the moderator in seeing inappropriate messages
*	As a university I want the possibility to have multiple rooms at the same time so that more lecturers can make use of the application 
*	As a teacher I want scoring system that takes popularity / age in account so that I only see the most relevant questions 
*	As a teacher I want the ability to schedule rooms so that I can plan beforehand 
*	As a teacher I want different joining codes for students and moderators so that I can delegate who the moderator will be 

**Could have:**
*	As a teacher / moderator I want that students can only ask a certain amount of questions per time frame so that the teacher doesn’t get spammed.
*	As a teacher I want the questions to be real time (push pull system) so that the questions are relevant
*	As a moderator I want the ability to merge similar questions so that similar questions are under one question
*	As a student I want to be able to add tags to my questions so that its more clear about what the questions is
*	As a teacher I want the ability to have polling questions (also for open questions) so that I can interact more with the students and don’t rely on other platforms for this
*	As a student I want a starting guide so that I exactly know how to operate the application
