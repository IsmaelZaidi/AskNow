Week 3 in review
What went well:
- Met again on Thursday to do more work on the project
- Finalised the backlog
- Added the required docs in the gitlab repo
- Added the backlog as issues
- Added the development brach
- Started to modify the design mockup for the new requirements
- Everyone has the codebase initialised in Intellij
What did not go so well:
- We still didn’t have an agenda before the TA meeting
- Couldn’t manage to finalise the design
- Didn’t start working on the code
What we can improve
- Better time management (meeting more often? / earlier before the TA meeting?)
What are we doing next
- Finish the mock-up
- Convert user stories to specific tasks we can work on (as devs)
- Start working on the code
