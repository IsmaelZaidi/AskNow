What went well

Since this was our first week and no proper development was done, everything went well.

- the team was active and fast responding to any of our questions;
- we figured out together how git and committing works and managed to get acquainted to our own
project;
- we set up a general code of conduct where we discussed some of the cases that we will encounter as
development goes on;
- we set up 2 ways of communication, one for fast and direct messages and one for sharing files and
announcements, a very efficient way of sharing information between the group members;
- we managed to have 2 meetings aside the TA and CTA ones, and planned them really fast, with an
attendance rate of 100%;
- we exchanged personal information and discussed topics outside of the OOP project, creating a bond;
- we decided upon platforms to help us track who is working on what (Trello)
- created a mock-up design of the project
- took detailed notes of all the meeting we have created

What did not go well

- nothing until now;

What we can improve

- firstly, we should do some test with Trello to figure out what is a good way of displaying you progress to
the team;
- actual more development focused meetings, which can be between anywhere form 2 to 6 participants;
- our still in development knowledge in git;

What are we doing next

- focusing more on the design of the app more detailed drafts and talking about communicating
information to the user;
- starting development on the development branch;
- devising roles for developments;
- adding more rules into our code of conduct if we found out we missed anything important;


- create a paper design on how the algorithms currently in development work, before starting actually
development;
