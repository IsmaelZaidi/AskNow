 Week 6 in review
 What went well:
 - Agenda was ready and uploaded before meeting
 - Creating rooms and upvoting has been implemented
 - Retrieving participants (users), API for asking question (in development)
 - Server-checkstyle errors fixed
 - Client-checkside errors fixed and fully implemented JavaFX into the project
 - Creating the student and teacher's view windows
 - Wrote a few endpoints
 - Finish API for creating room, joining a room, sending messages, upvoting, editing and deleting messages
 - Nearly finalized back-end

 What did not go so well:
 - Still possible to improve getting to know String build code better
 - Some window templates do not include ListView
 - Not all files in the repository are created in the same application

 What we can improve:
 - Get more experience in using the Sping build code
 - Discuss and work on the window templates more
 - Use the board of issues more frequently

 What we are doing next:
 - Adding ListView into all the window templates
 - Completely finalizing back-end
 - See more functionality between the back-end and the front-end
 - Maybe have a working demo by the end of next week
