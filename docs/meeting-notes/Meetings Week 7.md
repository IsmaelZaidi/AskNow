TA meeting Notes:
- Action point -> Creating agenda way before maybe start meeting on monday
- Websockets is fine if main communication is rest API (so websockets coudn't be the core) (this was also the question we had)
- Don't let anyone commit for you 
- Commits should be for every small change
- Everyone should have done about the same
- Keep in mind commits should all gravitate to same average and they should be spread
