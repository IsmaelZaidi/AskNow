Creating platform where students can ask questions during lectures so that the teacher can get immediate feedback. Platform intended to work past covid time.

### Bare minimum ( **must have** )

- support 1 lecture at a time (teacher create the lecture room and students creating / delete / edit questions).
- Both teacher and students should have the chat interface.
- Teacher view only shows the most popular questions (don&#39;t spam teacher) button so put answered question or discard question button.
- Students can&#39;t reply to each other
- Option for upvotes / speed

### Extra features ( **should have** )

- Introduction of moderators (hide / delete / rephrase questions / possibility to ban IP) tjey service as a filter only teacher answers the questions
- Students can report spam questions
- Support multiple rooms at the same time
- No authentication system, Create room and then with code students can log in (anonymous) / moderators should get separate code that the teacher should see
- More complex chat system (takes age in consideration (most upvoted in certain time))
- An Option that rooms can be scheduled (share code beforehand) (indication when lecture hasn&#39;t started)
- Might need to have persistent database so that questions stay there (not certain yet)

### Extra mile features ( **can be** )

- Optimizations: have real time questions (push pull system) client sends new question and server sends new question to teacher

- Limit questions students can ask

### Accessibility features:

- Colour-blind people should work normal (use colour scheme that works for everyone) (create report if you chose custom mode (use colour-blind software))
- Getting started guide
- Merge questions (moderator) by this only moderator has control over question you take max upvote of question) option like discord (edited) visible when merged (&quot;this is the result of 4 questions&quot;)
- Students able to add tags to questions (static tags / custom tags)
- Polling feature (teacher view can see the polling results) (also for open questions)

### Question for next week:

- What happens if teacher leaves room by accident?

### What to do for next week:

- !For next meeting proper backlog, prioritize in moscow system and present backlog (user stories) a possible UI sketch, presenting would be easier!
