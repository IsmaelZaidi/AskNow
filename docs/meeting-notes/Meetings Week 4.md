# TA Meeting â€“ Week 4

Date: March 2nd, 2021

# Main body

- Discussed all tasks that require attention and how we are going to divide them
- Examples of first couple of tasks:
  - Connecting the fore-hand to the back-end
  - Track if any project members have any experience regarding coding, what their interests in the projects are in order for all the members to be happy with their role in the group whilst being efficient and making progress
- OpenFX is the recommended tool to create the design since we are not making a website, but a desktop application
- Division of tasks is completely up to us, recommended that every person gets some experience on every part of the project
- Despite teams being divided, it would be the best they work on the same pace since one team can always help another as long as they are informed on time

# TA points:

- Boards are well designed; some complaints include:
  - user stories that should be changed to an alternative
  - have the tasked pinpointed to something very specific rather than more broad in order for the problems to have a clear solution
  - reformatting the board: keep the stories, but associate them to discrete tasks
- have the tasks assigned to a person to have someone responsible for the tasks
- try to have one consistent format for managing our files such as PDF (recommended by TA)
- possible reorganization in boards: creating multiple boards such as for critical issues, must-haves, should-haves etc.
- expected to do some coding, doesn&#39;t have to be major block of code, and create a merge request
